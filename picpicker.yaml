# PicPicker accepts one or more sources
# i.e. places where you have pictures you want to
# include in your selection.
#
# All params are mandatory unless stated otherwise.
# They can be blank/empty, but must be specified.
sources:
  
  # Give each source a name
  'My Pictures':
    
    # Specify the base path where your pictures are stored.
    # It can be in Windows or Unix format, and you can use 
    # forward slashes even on Windows.
    path: 'D:/mypictures' 
    
    # File pattern accepts Globs, the extended Unix style 
    # pathname extension.
    # Reference: https://www.malikbrowne.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-glob-patterns
    # Patterns are applied recursively, i.e. the example below picks
    # all JPG files in all directories and every subdirectory
    filePattern: '/**/*.jpg'

    # Any file/directory name containing the text indicated here 
    # will be entirely excluded from the final selection.
    # Patterns are case sensitive.
    exclude: 
      - 'révéillon'
      - 'drunken karaoke'

    # To limit the amount of files picked from a directory
    # (e.g. you want a maximum of 10 files from the 'baby pictures' folder)
    # indicate the number of files, or a percentage of the
    # total files, to include, alongside the directory name.
    # Patterns are case sensitive.
    limit:
      - 1 'liquéur night'
      - 10 'baby-pictures'
      - 25% 'birthday-party'

    # To always pick a minimum of files from a directory,
    # indicate the number or percentage of files here.
    # If you want all files from a directory, just use 100%.
    # Patterns are case sensitive.
    ensure:
      - 4 'séance centre'
      - 10 'Pumpkin farm visit'
      - 100% 'secret-santa'

# Target is the destination directory where your picks
# will be copied to.
# All file names WILL be changed to a random number; this
# is to ensure pictures are always shown in a random order
target:
  path: 'D:/pickedpics'
  
  # As most cheap digital picture frames have low resolution,
  # set the screen width/height in pixels here, so that
  # photos can be resized accordingly.
  maxWidth: 1024
  maxHeight: 600 

  # OPTIONAL configuration settings
  # ======================================

  # Crop images to fill the picture width.
  # This prevents "black bars" on the edges if the image
  # does not have the exact aspect ratio of the frame screen.
  # Applies ONLY to landscape-oriented pictures
  cropToFill: True

  # Portrait images don't display well on landscape picture frames, so
  # this option merges two portrait images into one in an artistic fashion.
  twoPortraits: True

  # Set how many megabytes of pictures you want selected here.
  # Useful when you have a limited capacity USB stick/SD card.
  maxMegabytes: 100

  # If you have too many pictures, or too much storage, you can
  # set a maximum amount of files to copy. 
  # This may be necessary as FAT32 volumes won't accept more than
  # 64K files in a single directory.
  maxFiles: 40

  # Apply text to the pictures with the file location,
  # e.g. files from `/Vacation/Paris 2022` will be
  # labeled "Vacation - Paris 2022".
  # Note that the source base path is not included.
  applyLabel: True

  # Wipe the target folder before starting.
  # Subdirectories (and files in them) are preserved.
  wipeTarget: True

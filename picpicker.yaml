# PicPicker accepts one or more sources
# i.e. places where you have pictures you want to
# include in your selection
sources:
  
  # Give each source a name
  'My Pictures':
    
    # Specify the base path where your pictures are stored.
    # It can be in Windows or Unix format, and you can use 
    # forward slashes even on Windows.
    path: 'D:/mypictures' 
    
    # File pattern accepts Globs, the extended Unix style 
    # pathname extension.
    # Reference: https://www.malikbrowne.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-glob-patterns
    # Patterns are applied recursively, i.e. the example below picks
    # all JPG files in all directories and every subdirectory
    filePattern: '/**/*.jpg'

    # Any file/directory name containing the text indicated here 
    # will be entirely excluded from the final selection
    exclude: 
      - 'drunken-karaoke'

    # To limit the amount of files picked from a directory
    # (e.g. you want a maximum of 10 files from the 'baby pictures' folder)
    # indicate the number of files, or a percentage of the
    # total files, to include, alongside the directory name.
    limit:
      - 10 'baby-pictures'
      - 25% 'birthday-party'

    # To always pick a minimum of files from a directory,
    # indicate the number or percentage of files here.
    # If you want all files from a directory, just use 100%.      
    ensure:
      - 10 'Pumpkin farm visit'
      - 100% 'secret-santa'

# Target is the destination directory where your picks
# will be copied to.
# All file names WILL be changed to a random number; this
# is to ensure pictures are always shown in a random order
target:
  path: 'D:\pickedpics'
  
  # As most cheap digital picture frames have low resolution,
  # you can set the screen width/height in pixels here, and all
  # photos will be resized to this height. Aspect ratio and
  # picture orientation are preserved.
  maxWidth: 1024
  maxHeight: 600

  # Set how many megabytes of pictures you want selected here.
  # Useful when you have a limited capacity USB stick/SD card.
  maxSize: 100
